# Asset Price Prediction Project with Machine Learning 

Predicts asset prices based on three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a polynomial kernel, and XGBoost Classifier.
It trains each model on the training data and evaluates its performance using ROC-AUC scores on both training and validation sets.
Should work with any asset, here I used bitcoin as an example and the historical data is included in the csv file
